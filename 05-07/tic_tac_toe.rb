## May 7 Homework Assignment
## Tic Tac Toe
## The game lets 2 players play tic tac toe from the console
## You win by getting 3 of the same letters in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
## A draw happens if the board gets filled without either player getting 3 of the same letters in a row
## A player chooses which letter they will play with, and they only enter that letter during their turn
## Each player gets one turn to enter a letter into a space.
## A space only holds one letter, and after a letter is entered it can't be deleted from that space
## The next player's turn starts after the previous player has entered their letter into a space.
## The game ends when one player wins or there is a draw
